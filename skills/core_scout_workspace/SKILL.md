## Purpose
- Read the workspace quickly, map the project, and identify the files that matter.
- This is a **core specialist** for OpenClaw operators who need a result that can survive review, handoff, or execution.

## Use when
- Use before planning or editing when the task depends on repository or document context.
- The main bottleneck is best solved through core work rather than generic brainstorming.

## Avoid when
- Do not use for purely conceptual requests with no project files and no need for local context.

## Inputs to gather
- User objective, scope boundary, deadline, and success condition.
- Known constraints, approvals, and any actions that must stay reversible.
- The smallest set of files, notes, tools, or prior decisions that affect the next move.

## Operating rules
- Scan breadth first before going deep.
- Prefer representative files over exhaustive reading.
- Track what is known, unknown, and probably stale.

- Before planning, audit the current state. Plans built on stale assumptions are worse than no plan.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient action. Overplanning is procrastination with a Gantt chart.
- Name the decision, the decider, and the deadline. Decisions without owners and deadlines are wishes.
- Every plan must state what would cause it to change. Rigid plans break; plans with exit criteria adapt.
- Distinguish between reversible and irreversible decisions. Spend 10x more time on irreversible ones and 10x less on reversible ones.
## OpenClaw tool pattern
- Start by reading the local context that changes the decision instead of front-loading every file.
- Use search/read to map the problem first; only edit or execute after the plan and blast radius are clear.
- Leave a compact reasoning trail so later skills can pick up without repeating discovery work.

## Expanded workflow
1. Map the top-level structure and identify the active stack.
2. Read the project brief, readme, package manifests, and core entry points.
3. Find the smallest file set relevant to the user request.
4. Summarize the current state before proposing changes.
## Output contract
- Project map
- Relevant files
- Known constraints
- Unanswered questions
- Next action or decision recommendation.
- Dependencies, risks, and the smallest follow-up check that closes the loop.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Planning too much after the next action is already obvious.
- Skipping routing and forcing the wrong specialist to own the work.
- Producing ceremony instead of a decision-ready next step.

## Handoff cues
- Workspace map: project structure, key files, relevant context.
- Any setup issues or missing dependencies discovered.
- Recommended next steps for the incoming task.

## Example invocation
- Primary use: internal or autonomous routing when the task pattern matches.
- Natural language: "Use core Scout Workspace to read the workspace quickly, map the project, and identify the files that matter."
- Example: "Route this mixed request and tell me the smallest safe next step."
- Example: "Plan the task, then tell me what context actually matters before we touch files."
- Often paired with: `core_route_request`, `core_plan_task`, `core_verify_done`

## Quality bar

- Every relevant file is inventoried with purpose and freshness noted.
- Stale or orphaned files are flagged for review.
- The workspace structure is documented well enough for a new operator to navigate.
- Key dependencies and config files are identified.
- The next action is specific enough to start immediately without further clarification.
- Assumptions are explicitly named, not hidden in the plan.
- The plan states what would trigger a re-evaluation.
- Someone else could execute the plan from the document alone.
## Related workflows

- Decision chain: `core_evidence_research` → `core_decision_record` → `core_handoff_summary`
