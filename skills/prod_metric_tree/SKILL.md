# Metric Tree

## Purpose
- Turn a goal into leading metrics, diagnostic signals, and ownership paths instead of vanity numbers.
- This is a **product specialist** for OpenClaw operators who need a result that can survive review, handoff, or execution.
- Prefer this skill when a structured operating pass will outperform a generic answer.

## Use when
- Use when a team knows the goal but not which signals to watch or improve first.
- The main bottleneck is best solved through product work rather than generic brainstorming.
- There is enough context to act, or the first useful move is to identify what is missing.

## Avoid when
- Do not produce a metric tree with no link to actual decisions or owners.
- Do not use it to add ceremony when a short direct answer would solve the task.
- Stop and re-route if the task crosses into a higher-risk domain than this skill is meant to handle alone.

## Inputs to gather
- Target user, job to be done, current behavior, and the decision or artifact needed.
- Known constraints around scope, timing, engineering capacity, and metrics.
- Existing feedback, research, retention data, or pricing context that should shape the recommendation.
- Acceptance threshold: what would make the output ready for use, review, or handoff.

## Operating rules
- Metrics are useful only when they change behavior.
- Prefer a small tree with real levers over a giant reporting taxonomy.
- Separate outcome metrics from diagnostic inputs.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations so the operator can see what is proven versus inferred.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient move that improves clarity, decision quality, or execution momentum.
- When context is stale or incomplete, name the gap instead of hiding it inside confident language.

## OpenClaw tool pattern
- Read source material such as feedback notes, specs, roadmap items, or analytics before jumping to solutions.
- Keep recommendations tied to user behavior, value delivery, and the smallest coherent product move.
- Pair opinionated recommendations with assumptions and the signal that would validate them.
- Keep the workspace state legible: summarize touched files, consulted sources, and checks performed when they materially affect trust.

## Expanded workflow
1. Define the top goal and decision cadence.
2. Break it into leading and diagnostic signals.
3. Assign likely owners and action levers.
4. Recommend the smallest useful measurement system.
5. Check the draft against the original request and remove anything that does not change the outcome.
6. End with the exact next action, follow-up check, or approval path.

## Output contract
- Top goal
- Metric tree
- Owners
- Action levers
- Instrumentation gaps
- Prioritized recommendation with rationale and tradeoffs.
- Metric, experiment, or follow-up signal that would confirm the decision.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Optimizing for feature volume instead of user value or learning speed.
- Treating personas or journeys as decorative documents rather than decision tools.
- Returning a strategy answer with no testable next step.
- Declaring success before the output is usable by the next operator, owner, or decision-maker.

## Handoff cues
- State current status, remaining blockers, and the smallest next move.
- Name the files, pages, systems, or source material that another operator should read first.
- Flag approvals, missing evidence, or live-system access that still require a human decision.

## Example invocation
- Slash: `/prod_metric_tree <task>`
- Natural language: "Use metric Tree to turn a goal into leading metrics, diagnostic signals, and ownership paths instead of vanity numbers."
- Example: "Shape this product decision around the user problem and the fastest path to learning."
- Example: "Turn scattered product input into one recommendation we can actually act on."
- Often paired with: `prod_feature_priority`, `prod_experiment_design`

## Quality bar
- A metric tree is good when it points the team toward better decisions rather than prettier dashboards.
- The result should reduce ambiguity or risk, not merely add more words.
- A good pass leaves a clear next action, owner, or verification step.
