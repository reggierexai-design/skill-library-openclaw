# AI Model Routing

## Purpose
- Choose which model handles which work based on quality, speed, cost, and risk.
- This is an **AI specialist** for OpenClaw operators who need a result that can survive review, handoff, or execution.
- Prefer this skill when a structured operating pass will outperform a generic answer.

## Use when
- Use when a system has multiple models or providers with different strengths and limits.
- The main bottleneck is best solved through ai work rather than generic brainstorming.
- There is enough context to act, or the first useful move is to identify what is missing.

## Avoid when
- Do not route randomly or by price alone when task quality matters.
- Do not use it to add ceremony when a short direct answer would solve the task.
- Stop and re-route if the task crosses into a higher-risk domain than this skill is meant to handle alone.

## Inputs to gather
- Target workflow, users, models, tools, context sources, and failure tolerance.
- Existing prompts, evals, logs, incidents, or product requirements that define the current system.
- What is needed now: system design, routing logic, evals, memory policy, or guardrail review.
- Acceptance threshold: what would make the output ready for use, review, or handoff.

## Operating rules
- Route by task shape, not brand loyalty.
- Keep the default path simple.
- Define escalation and fallback clearly.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations so the operator can see what is proven versus inferred.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient move that improves clarity, decision quality, or execution momentum.
- When context is stale or incomplete, name the gap instead of hiding it inside confident language.

## OpenClaw tool pattern
- Treat agent behavior as a system: prompts, tools, context, memory, evals, and failure handling must agree.
- Read the current prompt, tool schema, examples, and runtime constraints before proposing architecture changes.
- Prefer designs that are testable, observable, and cheap to iterate rather than clever but fragile.
- Keep the workspace state legible: summarize touched files, consulted sources, and checks performed when they materially affect trust.

## Expanded workflow
1. List the main task classes and constraints.
2. Match each class to a primary model and a fallback.
3. Define escalation rules and failure handling.
4. Return a routing policy that can be implemented and tested.
5. Check the draft against the original request and remove anything that does not change the outcome.
6. End with the exact next action, follow-up check, or approval path.

## Output contract
- Task classes
- Primary and fallback models
- Escalation rules
- Tradeoffs
- System recommendation, policy, or design doc with clear evaluation hooks.
- Failure modes, guardrails, and the smallest next experiment to de-risk the design.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Trying to solve a systems problem with prompt wording alone.
- Adding retrieval, memory, or tools without a concrete failure mode they must solve.
- Skipping eval design and then guessing whether the change helped.
- Declaring success before the output is usable by the next operator, owner, or decision-maker.

## Handoff cues
- State current status, remaining blockers, and the smallest next move.
- Name the files, pages, systems, or source material that another operator should read first.
- Flag approvals, missing evidence, or live-system access that still require a human decision.

## Example invocation
- Slash: `/ai_model_routing <task>`
- Natural language: "Use aI Model Routing to choose which model handles which work based on quality, speed, cost, and risk."
- Example: "Design the agent path so it is testable, safe, and not dependent on luck."
- Example: "Review this prompt or tool system and tell me the real failure modes and fixes."
- Often paired with: `ai_prompt_system`, `ai_eval_harness`, `ai_guardrail_review`

## Quality bar
- Good routing saves money without quietly degrading the user experience.
- The result should reduce ambiguity or risk, not merely add more words.
- A good pass leaves a clear next action, owner, or verification step.
